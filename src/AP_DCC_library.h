// file:      AP_DCC_library.h
// purpose:   DCC library for ATmega AVRs (16, 328, 2560, ...)
// author:    Aiko Pras
// version:   2021-05-15 V1.0.2 ap initial version
//            2024-12-11 V1.0.3 ap comments improved for "position" attribute
//            2025-05-12 V1.1.0 ap/lr binaryStates are now supported (RCN-212: Sections 2.3.5 & 2.3.6)
//
// history:   This is a further development of the OpenDecoder 2 software, as developed by W. Kufer.
//            It has been rewritten such that it can be used for Arduino (Atmel AVR) environments.
//            For details, see the .cpp file
//
// usage:     The main sketch should declare the following objects:
//            - extern Dcc           dcc;     // The main DCC object
//            - extern Accessory     accCmd;  // To retrieve the data from accessory commands
//            - extern Loco          locoCmd; // To retrieve the data from loco commands  (7 & 14 bit)
//            - extern CvAccess      cvCmd;   // To retrieve the data from pom and sm commands
//            Setup() should call dcc.dccPin). dccPin is the interrupt pin for the DCC signal
//            The main loop() should call dcc.input() as often as possible. If there is input,
//            dcc.cmdType tells what kind of command was received (such as MyAccessoryCmd or MyLocoF0F4Cmd).
//
//            Note that command stations will periodically retransmit certain commands, to ensure
//            that, even in noisy environments, commands will be received. Such retransmissions
//            will be filtered within this library. The main sketch will not receive retransmissions.
//
// hardware:  - On traditional ATMega processors Timer 2 is used.
//              On novel (MegaCoreX, DxCore) ATMega processors, TCB0 is used (another TCB may be
//              selected by uncommenting the associated #define in sup_isr_MegaCoreX_DxCore.h
//              In addition, on these new processors, also a free Event channel and some General
//              PurPose Data Registers (GPIOR0 - GPIOR2) are used.
//            - a free to chose interrupt pin (dccpin) for the DCC input signal
//            - a free to chose digital output pin for the DCC-ACK signal

//                                            ACCESSORY COMMANDS
//******************************************************************************************************
// The NMRA Standard 9.2.1 and RCN-213 define two types of accessory commands:
// 1) Basic accessory command, used for switches and similar
// 2) Extended accessory command, used for signals, turntables and other, more complex devices
// *** command (basic..extended) ***
// The "command" attribute indicates whether a basic or an extended accessory command was received.
// All command stations can generate basic accessory commands, but only a few support extended accesory
// commands. The LENZ LZV101 (with Xpressnet V3.6) for example can't, but the OpenDCC command station
// can generate extended accesory commands.
//
// Commands for accessory decoders contain fields that can be interpreted in different ways, depending
// on the specific decoder that is being implemented.
//
// OPTION 1: Decoder based addressing (basic):
// The most common type of accessory decoder is the switch decoder, which connects upto 4 switches.
// Such decoders understand basic accesory commands, and their fields can be interpreted as follows:
// *** decoderAddress (0..511) ***
// The address of the decoder (board). The NMRA standard defines 9-bits for decoder addresses, although
// some command stations (like the LENZ LZV101 with XpressNet V3.6)  support only 8 bits (0..255).
// *** turnout (1..4) ***
// The "turnout" attribute tells which of the four switches is being targetted.
//
// OPTION 2: Output based addressing (basic and extended)
// *** outputAddress (1..2048) ***
// Instead of addressing decoders (that connect multiple switches), it is also possible to directly
// address individual switches or other outputs (relays, signals, turntables etc). Output addresses
// are 11 bits in length, and consists basically of the concatenation of the "decoderAddress" and
// the "switch" attributes.
//
// *** position (0..1) *** (basic)
// Most switches can be positioned via two coils or servos. The "position" attribute tells which of
// the two coils is being targetted. Unfortunately different command stations made different choices
// regarding the interpretation of 0 or 1. According to RCN-213, a value 0 is used for "diverging"
// tracks (red), whereas the value 1 is used for "straight" tracks (green). Some command stations
// use '-' for 0, or '+' for 1 to indicate the position.
//
// *** device (1..8) *** (basic)
// In case of relays or other on/off devices usage of the "turnout" and "position" attributes may seem
// artificial. In such cases the "device" attribute may be used instead.
//
// *** activate (0..1) *** (basic)
// Whether the output should be actived (on) or deactivated (off).
//
// *** signalHead (0..255) *** (extended)
// The value contained in the extended accessory command. The NMRA S-9.2.1 standard allocates 5 bits,
// allowing values between 0 and 31, whereas the RCN-213 standard allocates 8 bits, thus 0..255
// Can be used to display different signal heads, but might also be used for turntables or other,
// more complex devices.
//
// RELATION BETWEEN ATTRIBUTES
// In case of a basic accesory command:
// - outputAddress (11 bits) = decoderAddress (9 bits) + turnout (2 bits)
// - device (3 bits) = turnout (2 bits) + position (1 bit)
// Since all attributes will get the correct values, the choice which attributes to use is upto
// the sletch writer.
//
// ADDRESSING DETAILS
// The broadcast outputAddress is 2047.
//
// Different command station manufacturers made different choices regarding the exact coding
// of the address bits within the DCC packet. See "sup_acc.cpp" for details.
// In many cases these differences can be neglected, unless the decoder address will also be
// used for other purposes, such as calculating CV values, or generating feedback / POM addresses.
// The "myMaster" attribute can be set by the main sketch to "Lenz", "OpenDcc" or "Roco"
// to deal with different command station behavior. The default value is "Lenz".
//
// An Accesory Decoder may listen to one or multiple decoder addresses, for example if it supports more than
// four switches or skips uneven addresses. After startup, a call should be made to setMyAddress().
// If the call includes a single parameter, that parameter represents the (single) address this decoder
// will listen to. If the call includes two parameters, these parameters represent the range of addresses
// this decoder will listen to.

//                           CV-ACCESS (SM AND POM) FOR LOCO AND ACCESSORY DECODER
//******************************************************************************************************
// The behavior of the decoder is determined by the setting of certain Configuration Variables (CVs)
// Commands to access these variables can be send in Service Mode (SM = Programming Track) or in
// Programming on the Main (PoM) mode. This decoder supports both modes.
//
// According to S-9.2.1, PoM supports 2 methods to access Configuration Variables (CVs): Short form
// and Long form. Of these, only the long form is implemented by this Library
//
// According to S-9.2.3, Service Mode supports 4 methods to access Configuration Variables (CVs):
// Direct Configuration, Address-Only, Physical Register, and Paged Addressing.
// Of these, only Direct Configuration is implemented by this Library
//
// There are several conditions to be satisfied before CV access commands can be accepted.
// In SM, a reset packet must be received before a CV access command may be accepted, and timeouts
// must be obeyed. Only the second command may be acted upon. This library ensures that all these
// conditions are met.
//
// To determine the value of a specific CV, a Command Station usualy sends 8 consecutive verify bit
// commands, one to check each individual bit of the 8-bit variable. After that, the Command Station
// may issue a verify byte command, to ensure no errors occured.
