// file:     MegaCoreX_DxCore.h
// purpose:  DCC receive code for ATmegaX processors, such as ATmega 4808, 4809, AVR DA, AVR DB, ...
//           using a MegaCoreX or DxCore board
// author:   Aiko Pras
// version:  2021-09-01 V1.2.0 ap - Uses the Event system to connect the DCC input pin to a TCB timer.
//           2024-06-04 V1.2.1 ap - Error corrected in cases where the preamble had an uneven number
//                                  of halfbits. This error showed up with DxCore and the Z21 system.
//                                  Some comments are added for implementing RailCom feedback.
//           2025-05-16 V1.2.2 ap   Moved to Variants sub directory
//
// Result:   1. The received message is collected in the struct "dccrec.tempMessage".
//           2. After receiving a complete message, data is copied to "dccMessage.data".
//           3. The flag "dccMessage.isReady" is set.
//
// Used hardware resources:
//  - DccPin: Any ATmega pin can be used to receive the DCC input signal
//            Polarity of the J/K signal is not important.
//  - Timer:  One TCB timer. Default is TCB0, but the default can be changed by setting one of the
//            #defines (DCC_USES_TIMERB1, DCC_USES_TIMERB2 or DCC_USES_TIMERB3)
//            No dependancies exist with other timers, thus the TCA prescaler is NOT used.
//  - Event:  One of the Event channels available in ATmegaX processors.
//            The software automatically selects an available channel.
//            Not every pin can be connected to every Event channel. If other software has already
//            claimed usage of some channels, it might be necessary to select a DCC input pin on 
//            another port. See also: https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX#event-system-evsys
//
// Howto: This part of the library takes advantage of the Event system peripheral that is implemented
// in the novel ATmegaX processors, and which is supported by MegaCoreX and DxCore.
// The DCC pin is used as input for an Event channel. The output of that Event channel triggers a TCB
// timer in 'Capture Frequency Measurement Mode'. If an event occurs in this Mode, the TCB
// captures the counter value (TCBn.CNT) and stores this value in TCBn.CCMP. The Interrupt flag is
// automatically cleared after the low byte of the Compare/Capture (TCBn.CCMP) register is read.
// The value in TCBn.CCMP is the number of ticks since the previous event, thus the time since the
// previous DCC signal transition. This time determines if the received DCC signal represents (half of)
// a zero or one bit.
// Since we do not want to introduce any dependency between our TCB timer and the TCA prescaler, 
// TCB is used at clock speed. This requires us to use TCB in 16 bit mode. If we would have used the
// TCA prescaler, TCB could have been run in 8-bit mode, saving us roughly 8 clock cycli.
// To conform to the RCN-210 standard, we measure the times for both first as well as second half bit.
// Therefore the TCB ISR is called twice for every DCC bit.
// Since the TCB can only trigger on positive or negative edges of the input signal, the trigger
// direction is inverted after each interrupt.
//
// This code uses the Event system of MegaCoreX and DxCore:
// https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX#event-system-evsys
// https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore 
//
// Note: Railcom feedback has not been implemented.
// Implementation could be relatively easy by using an additional timer to determine the exact moment
// the railcom data should be send. This moment could be the moment that the Packet End Bit is detected
// (see sup_isr_assemble_packet.h). Once this railcom timer fires, a UART starts sending the railcom
// data. The Event and CCL peripherals can be used to connect the RailCom timer with the UART and the
// RailCom output pin.
