// file:      AP_DCC_library.cpp
// purpose:   DCC library for ATmega AVRs (16, 328, 2560, ...)
// author:    Aiko Pras
// version:   2021-06-01 V1.0.2 ap initial version
//
// history:   This is a further development of the OpenDecoder 2 software, as developed by W. Kufer.
//            It has been rewritten, such that it can be used for Arduino (Atmel AVR) environments.
//            From a functional point of view, this code is comparable to (a subset of) the NMRA-DCC
//            library. However,it is believed that this code is easier to adapt and modify to personal needs.
//            This Library has also been tested on ATMega16 and 2560 processors.
//            Like the OpenDecoder 2 Software and version 1.2 of the NMRA-DCC library, this code
//            uses a separate Timer (Timer2) to decode the DCC signal. However, as opposed to some
//            other code bases, the DCC input (interrupt pin) can be freely chosen. In contrast to
//            to the NMRA-DCC version 2 library, this code doesn't use callback functions, in an
//            attempt to improve the readability of the main loop for cases where the action to be
//            taken should not depend on the trigger source. For example, the code for setting a switch
//            should be the same, irrespective whether the trigger is a DCC-message or a button push.
//            To improve readability, mainainability and extendibility, many comments were included
//            and an attempt is made to structure the code more clearly.
// reference: This code follows the NMRA DCC standard S9.2 S9.2.1 and S9.2.3 as well as RCN211-RCN214
//            (in German, by railcommunity.org), which include more detailed descriptions as well as
//            the differences in accesory decoder addresses.
